# JavaScript Bonus Challenges

Here are some **optional** extra challenges for the Christmas break. Some of these challenges are more puzzle based and may seem to be more difficult than some you have faced. They are presented in no particular order. Feel free to try as many or as few as you like. 

## Setup

This assumes that you have NodeJS and Yarn installed.

1. clone this repository.
2. cd into the new folder.
3. run `yarn install` to install testing dependencies.

## Tests

All challenges come with a series of automated tests. Due to the way that Jest, the testing framework, works, you will need to specify the folder that you want to run the tests for. So `yarn test` + the folder name.

For example, to run the tests for the `fizzbuzz` challenge use `yarn test fizzbuzz/` you should beable to tab complete the folder name.
